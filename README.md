# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-LSTM
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It utilizes historical stock data to train an LSTM model and forecasts future prices. Ideal for financial forecasting, trend analysis, and investment research.
## üîç Features

- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- LSTM model built using TensorFlow & Keras  
- Training visualization: Loss over epochs  
- Future price prediction based on recent trends  
- Actual vs Predicted price comparison  
- User-interactive prediction cell (via Google Colab)
